Welcome and congratulations on your enrollment to Data Science Methodology program at Barcelona School of Economics.

This is the web-page of the programming brush-up course: Introductory and Intermediate Computing for Data Science 2022. I will be uploading all the exercises and contents of the course before the course starts.

Have a look at the <a href="docs/syllabus.pdf" target="_blank">syllabus</a> and the welcome email that you've got from the program office to learn more about this course.

There is [Hello World Assignment](./python-1-hello-world.md) which will help you to set up your programming tools and prepare for the course.
